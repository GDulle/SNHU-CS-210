#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program takes an initial deposit amount, the annual interest to be compounded, the amount of monthly deposits, and the number of years for the investment to mature. With this information it will calculate the amount of money that would be in this account annually both with and without monthly deposits.

#What did you do particularly well?
I'm the happiest with how I set up the object-orented nature of this program, I created objects for each year of data calculated. I'm also happy with how compartmentalized the program is with functions outside of main() and called only when they are needed.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these imporvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One step I would probably add to imporve functionality would be to add a loop to allow for the program to allow the user to check investments with different values without having to restart the whole program. 

#What pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found that the most difficult part was making sure that my code was getting the correct information to calculate the values for the next year. Because of similar variable names that I used I ran into bugs where I called the wrong variables to find the value of the next year and because of the similarity of my variables it took me a bit to find. I overcame this by going over the code and double checking and finding the incorrectly called variables. So with this project I built on my ability to de-bug my code which will surely be a good skill to develop.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Building on my skills writing programs with object-oriented programming paradigms will be particularly transferable due to the importance of this in making any sort of program where information being collected into these objects is helpful.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In this program I made sure to have all the calculations to determine information for the next year in the list contained in seperate functions to improve readability, and adaptability as any future additions to the program can work without having to account for these calculations.
